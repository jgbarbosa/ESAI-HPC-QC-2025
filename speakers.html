                            <p class="speaker-bio">Lubomir Riha, Ph.D. (male), is Head of the Infrastructure Research Lab at IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center. Previously, he was a research scientist in the High-Performance Computing Lab at George Washington University, ECE Department. He received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Bowie State University, USA.</p>
                            <p class="speaker-bio">Currently, he is a local principal investigator of MAX3, SPACE, and POP3 EuroHPC Centers of Excellence and EPICURE (High-level Application Support Service in HPC) projects in which he and his team focus on performance and energy consumption optimization of complex parallel applications, porting to advanced HPC hardware, and high-fidelity visualization of large cosmological simulation datasets. Previously, he was a local PI of the H2020 POP2 CoE and READEX and EuroHPC SCALABLE project.</p>
                            <p class="speaker-bio">His research interests include energy-efficient computing, which includes the development of the energy-efficient MERIC suite. This research is currently funded by the EUPEX (designs of a prototype of the European Exascale machine), DARE (development of the European RISC-V based processor and accelerators), and SEANERGYS (development of the energy-aware software stack) EuroHPC projects, in which he is also a local PI.</p>
                            <p class="speaker-bio">He is also a co-founding developer of the scalable GPU-accelerated ESPRESO FEM library. Currently, this research is also funded by the FALCON (development of FSI solver by coupling with LBM CFD codes) and EUPEX (development of ARM CPU support and further development of GPU acceleration), in which he serves as local PI.</p>
                            <p class="speaker-bio">His broader research interests are optimization of HPC applications, energy-efficient computing, acceleration of scientific and engineering applications using GPU and modern many-core accelerators, and parallel and distributed rendering.</p>

                                <p style="color: #4a5568; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">This talk will address selected aspects of software-based methodologies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures executing parallel scientific applications. Particular attention will be given to the energy-aware runtime suite MERIC, developed at IT4Innovations, which encompasses system-level monitoring and control, job-level optimization techniques, and advanced 3D visualizations of supercomputer state. Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the European perspective on the development of a holistic, energy-aware software stack.</p>
